## A ʜᴀᴄᴋᴀʙʟᴇ sʜᴇʟʟ ꜰᴏʀ Hʏᴘʀʟᴀɴᴅ, ᴘᴏᴡᴇʀᴇᴅ ʙʏ [Fᴀʙʀɪᴄ](https://github.com/Fabric-Development/fabric/).

This is my own Fork of [Axenide's Ax-Shell](https://github.com/Axenide/Ax-Shell)

**There's a lot of stuff in here that probably wont work out of the box for anyone trying to use this.**

If you want to just run a script and have it work, take a look at the original Ax-Shell instead.

## Stuff i've changed from Axenide's implementations

- Notch opens and closes on hover (without click)
  - Exceptions:
    - When playing music; to still be able to use the player controls
    - When looking at kanban; to be able to drag Tasks better
- Implemented a sidebar:
  - Contains workspace switcher now
  - Has a download buttons that's implemented with aria2 to show progress and open ariang
  - Includes a VPN button to easily switch connected VPNs
- The network button opens a new terminal with nmtui
- Added matugen vesktop integration, so my discord theme changes as well
- Wallpaper picker changes wallpapers on a single click
- Ability to download wallpapers right from the wallpaper picker
- Added battery gauge to the notch (Thank you [nova](https://github.com/nova-r/)<3)
- New battery icons
- Changed scroll direction in small circular sliders for volume etc
- Margin and gap changes
- Increased max volume to 200
- Changed paths for files to make them work for myself
- Changed screen corners a bit
- Removed pins tab cause it doesnt work for me
- Removed the coming soon tab
- Removed example images to make the clone on nixos rebuild more slim (maybe)
